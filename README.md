#TexyTime

I've been spending alot of time copying and pasting references and editing them whilst writing in LaTeX recently, especially when it comes to referencing websites. I figured it would be much easier if I could grab the BibTeX (or at least most of it) straight from a website without even leaving the page. Enter __texyTime__!

## Growing Up

This is still in its infancy - it doesn't do anything fancy like extract authors from blogs or know the company that published the website, but it __does__ save time.

## Usage

1. Drag this link to your bookmarks bar (add a name too, some browsers don't by default)
2. Click the bookmark on your favourite page
3. Enter the name used for citation (or keep the default) and receive an instant BibTeX reference in an alert box
4. Paste it into your .bib file and add tweak anything that's not quite right
5. profit
