#TexyTime

I've been spending alot of time copying and pasting references and editing them whilst writing in LaTeX recently, especially when it comes to referencing websites. I figured it would be much easier if I could grab the BibTeX (or at least most of it) straight from a website without even leaving the page.

## Growing Up

This is still in its infancy - it doesn't do anything fancy like extract authors from blogs or know the company that published the website, but it __does__ save time.
